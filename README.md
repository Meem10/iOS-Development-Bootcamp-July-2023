# Introduction

Welcome to the iOS Development Bootcamp, an intensive and immersive program designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to become proficient iOS developers. Over the next 8 weeks, we will embark on an exciting journey through the world of iOS app development, covering essential topics such as Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Firebase integration, app testing, and much more.

## **Purpose**

At this bootcamp, our purpose is to cultivate world-class iOS developers who can build innovative and user-friendly mobile applications. We are passionate about empowering you to create meaningful and impactful apps that delight users and leave a lasting impression.

## Expectations

To make the most of this bootcamp, we expect learners to:

- Attend all bootcamp sessions regularly and punctually.
- Actively engage in discussions, ask questions, and participate in project work.
- Complete assignments and projects on time to reinforce your learning.
- Be open to constructive feedback and actively seek ways to improve your skills.
- Show dedication and passion for iOS development.

Remember, becoming a skilled iOS developer requires practice and persistence. Embrace the challenges, collaborate with your peers, and make the most of the learning opportunities provided.

## **Code of Conduct**

Throughout the bootcamp, we expect all learners to adhere to a code of conduct that promotes a positive and inclusive learning environment. Be respectful and supportive of your fellow learners, instructors, and mentors. Discrimination, harassment, and any form of harmful behavior will not be tolerated.

## **Your Journey**

Each week of the bootcamp is carefully designed to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience. From the basics of Swift and SwiftUI to advanced topics like Firebase integration, app testing, and app store optimization, you will gain a holistic understanding of the iOS app development process.

## **Graduation and Certification**

As you progress through the bootcamp, you will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects, showcase your skills, and build a strong portfolio that can open doors to exciting career opportunities in iOS development. Upon completion of the bootcamp, you will receive a certificate recognizing your achievements and participation.

# Overview

## **Goals**

1. **Mastery of Swift**: Learners will gain a deep understanding of the Swift programming language, including its syntax, data types, functions, and object-oriented principles.
2. **Proficiency in SwiftUI**: Attendees will become proficient in building modern, declarative user interfaces using SwiftUI, Apple's latest framework for app development.
3. **Familiarity with UIKit**: Learners will also get hands-on experience with UIKit, the foundational framework of iOS development, enabling them to work with existing codebases and tackle complex UI challenges.
4. **Project-Centric Learning**: Throughout the bootcamp, learners will complete four distinct projects that showcase their newly acquired skills, creativity, and ability to build practical and polished iOS applications.

## **Outcomes**

By the end of the bootcamp, learners will have completed the following four projects:

1. **Project 1: Simple Task Manager (Week 2)** - Create a basic task manager app using SwiftUI. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, and the app should maintain a persistent data store.
2. **Project 2: Weather App (Week 4)** - Develop a weather app that fetches data from a public API and displays weather conditions for a given location. Users can view current weather and a 5-day forecast, and the app should use a OpenWeatherAPI
3. **Project 3: Social Media Feed (Week 6)** - Build a social media feed app that fetches and displays posts from various users. Users can like, comment, and share posts, and the app should have a seamless user experience, and the app should use Firestore.
4. **Project 4: Custom iOS App (Week 8)** - Learners will conceptualize and build a unique iOS app of their choice. They will have the creative freedom to demonstrate their skills and showcase their ability to develop a complete app from scratch.
