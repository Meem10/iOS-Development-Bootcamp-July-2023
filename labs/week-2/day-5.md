## Objective:

In this lab, students will be introduced to Data Persistence in SwiftUI and learn how to store and retrieve data in their apps. They will explore various techniques for saving data locally, such as using UserDefaults, File-based Data Storage, and Core Data.

## Instructions:

1. Create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode to complete the lab tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.
3. Write your code in a clear and organized manner, following best practices.

## Requirements:

1. Xcode (latest version)
2. Basic knowledge of SwiftUI and Swift syntax

## Tasks:

### Task 1: UserDefaults Data Persistence

- Use UserDefaults to save and retrieve simple data like user settings or preferences.
- Create a simple form to allow users to enter and save their preferences.
- Display the saved data on the screen.

### Task 2: File-based Data Storage

- Implement file-based data storage using FileManager and Codable.
- Create a model structure for the data you want to save.
- Save the data to a file and load it back into the app.

### Task 3: Core Data Integration

- Integrate Core Data into your SwiftUI project.
- Design a Core Data model to represent the data you want to persist.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the Core Data entities.

## Submission Guidelines:

Submit the completed SwiftUI project via email to [Lab Instructor's Email].

## Grading Criteria:

Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:
- Correctness and completion of tasks (50%)
- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices (30%)
- Effective use of Data Persistence techniques (20%)

## Additional Notes:

- You may ask the lab instructor for assistance during lab hours.
- Avoid plagiarism; write the code yourself.
- Late submissions will not be accepted without prior approval.

## Deadline:

Submit your completed lab assignment by [Specified Deadline].
