# Objective:

In this lab, students will practice working with functions, closures, and higher-order functions in Swift. They will learn how to declare and use functions with various parameters and return types, explore function overloading and nested functions, and understand closures and their syntax. Additionally, they will apply higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce to manipulate data efficiently.

# Instructions:

1. Create a Swift playground or Xcode project to complete the tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.
3. Write your code in a clear and organized manner, following best practices.
4. Your code must be logically correct.

# Requirements:

1. Xcode v13 or higher installed
2. Swift compiler v5.7 or higher installed

# Tasks:

## Task 1: Function Basics

- Create a function `greetUser` that takes a `String` parameter and returns a greeting message.
- Call the function with different names and print the output.

## Task 2: Function Overloading

- Write two functions named `calculateArea`:
  - One that takes the radius of a circle and returns its area.
  - Another that takes the length and width of a rectangle and returns its area.
- Call both functions with appropriate arguments and display the results.

## Task 3: Nested Functions

- Define a function `mathOperation` that takes two integers and a string representing an operation ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide').
- Inside `mathOperation`, create nested functions for each operation and return the result accordingly.
- Call `mathOperation` with different numbers and operations.

## Task 4: Higher-Order Functions

- Create an array of integers and use the `map` function to transform each element by adding 1 to it.
- Use the `filter` function to keep only even numbers from the array.
- Utilize the `reduce` function to find the sum of all elements in the array.

## Task 5: Closures

- Create a closure that takes integer and multiply it by itself and returns the result of this multiplication.
- Create an array of integers and use the `map` function and pass your closure to the `map` function, finally print each element using `forEach` function.

# Submission Guidelines:

- Create new repository name it as "iOS-Developemnt-Bootcamp-July-2023-Week-1-Day-3-Lab".
- Upload your project files to the repo you just created.
- Submit your project repo link as comment to [here](https://github.com/learning-bootcamps/iOS-Development-Bootcamp-July-2023/issues/4).

# Grading Criteria:

Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Correctness and completion of tasks (50%)
- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices (50%)

# Additional Notes:

- You may ask the lab instructor for assistance during lab hours.
- Avoid plagiarism; write the code yourself.
- Late submissions will not be accepted without prior approval.

# Deadline:

Submit your completed lab assignment prior start of next session.
