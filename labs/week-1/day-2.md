# Objective:

In this lab, you will learn the basics of Swift language and essential programming concepts. By completing the tasks, you will gain proficiency in working with variables, constants, data types, control flow statements, collections, and strings.

# Instructions:

1. Create an empty Swift playground project.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.

# Requirements:

1. Xcode v13 or higher installed
2. Swift compiler v5.7 or higher installed

# Tasks:

## Task 1: Variable Practice

- Declare a variable called "score" and assign it an integer value.
- Update the value of "score" by adding 10 to it.
- Print the updated score.

## Task 2: Control Flow

- Use the "if/else" statement to check if the score is greater than 9.
- If the score is greater than 9, print "Pass," otherwise print "Fail."

## Task 3: Loop Practice

- Create an array of names with at least 5 elements.
- Use a "for" loop to print each name in the array.

## Task 4: Working with Dictionaries

- Create a dictionary with key-value pairs representing fruit names and their corresponding quantities (e.g., "apple": 3).
- Use a "for-in" loop to print each fruit name and its quantity.

## Task 5: String Interpolation

- Declare a constant "name" with your name as a string.
- Use string interpolation to print a welcome message that includes your name.

# Submission Guidelines:

- Create new repository name it as "iOS-Developemnt-Bootcamp-July-2023-Week-1-Day-2-Lab".
- Upload your project files to the repo you just created.
